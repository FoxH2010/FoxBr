# FoxBr
FoxH's Browser  

## What is FoxBr?  
Well, FoxBr is a GUI interface using CEF. This serves as a demo for a GUI for an existing browser.  

## I want to use FoxBr's GUI for my custom browser  
Short answer is, it's pretty much **impossible** (without PyQt). This is deeply rooted in PyQt, so should just serves as a place to take inspirations from.  

## How did you turn it into an executable?  
For Windows, you can use `pyinstaller`. You can download `pyinstaller` using `pip` with the following command:  
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```
