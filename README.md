# FoxBr
FoxH's Browser  

## What is FoxBr?  
Well, FoxBr is a GUI interface using CEF. This serves as a demo for a GUI for an existing browser. Though, if you want to actually use the GUI for, let's say, a custom browser that you've made, it would pretty much be impossible. This is deeply rooted in PyQt, so should just serves as a place to take inspirations from.
